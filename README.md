# veda-ts

A CLI oracle your coding agent consults for planning and review.

## Motivation

### Frontier intelligence is ridiculously priced

Frontier models are expensive. Fable 5 runs at $10/$50 per million tokens. Sol runs at $5/$30. K3 runs at $3/$15. These are the models you want for planning, debugging, and review. They are too expensive to drive every token of every coding session.

Instead, use an economical agent like DeepSeek V4 ($0.14/$0.28) or GLM 5.2 ($1.40/$4.40) as your main driver in the harness of your choice (Claude Code, Codex, Pi, or any agent that can shell out to a CLI). Then ask it to use veda to consult the expensive models only when it matters.

The driver writes the code. Veda brings in frontier intelligence only where it earns its cost.

Veda is that consultation channel. It wraps codex, claude-code, droid, pi, and agy (Google Antigravity CLI) behind personas (navigator-plan, navigator-chat, reviewer, worker).

### Heavy thinking, based on a few academic papers

Some problems are too hard for one call. Architectural design, subtle bugs, decisions with no clear answer. You want several independent attempts that converge on the right answer.

Veda's deep mode runs parallel solvers, each using a different strategy. A judge picks the best answer. A verifier kicks in when confidence is low. This is a homegrown Deepthink, inspired by:

- [Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171): sample diverse reasoning paths, aggregate the best
- [Universal Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17311): use an LLM as judge to select among candidates
- [Chain-of-Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11495): fact-check outputs before finalizing

## Quick Start

## Prerequisites

- **A backend CLI**, installed and authenticated:
  - [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), [claude-code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), [pi](https://github.com/jetdraft-pi), [droid](https://github.com/droid-ai/droid), or [agy](https://antigravity.google/product/antigravity-cli) (`brew install --cask antigravity-cli`, then authenticate once with an interactive `agy` session)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -g veda-ts

# 2. Run in your project
cd your-project
veda init                          # first-time setup: installs agent skills for pi/codex/claude

# 3. Hand a hard problem to your driver agent through a skill
#
#    After `veda init`, your agent (pi / codex / claude) auto-discovers the
#    bundled skills. The two you'll reach for most:
#      /veda:plan                — align on a plan with the Navigator (no execution)
#      /veda:plan-and-implement  — align, then carry out the plan
#
#    Pretend: a multi-tenant API needs a rate limiter — fairness, burst
#    tolerance, Redis vs in-memory tradeoffs. Type the slash command; your
#    agent shares your code and drives veda under the hood:
#
#      /veda:plan design a per-tenant rate limiter (fairness, burst tolerance, Redis vs in-memory)
#
#    Iterate with /veda:plan until the plan holds up, then ship it:
#
#      /veda:plan-and-implement the rate-limiter plan
```

After `veda init`, your driver agent (pi, codex, or claude) auto-discovers the bundled skills (`veda-plan`, `veda-plan-implement`, `veda-plan-implement-review`, `veda-deep-plan`, `veda-worker`) and can invoke veda on its own. Run `veda skills list` to verify they installed.

cd veda/veda-ts
bun install && bun run build
cp dist/veda ~/.local/bin/
```

## Install Agent Skills

Veda bundles five [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) (`veda-plan`,
`veda-plan-implement`, `veda-plan-implement-review`, `veda-deep-plan`,
`veda-worker`) that teach coding agents how to collaborate
with the Navigator / Reviewer models. One command installs them into the directories
read by **Pi**, **OpenAI Codex CLI**, and **Claude Code**:

```bash
veda skills install     # writes ~/.agents/skills/ + symlinks ~/.claude/skills/
veda skills list        # show install status and symlink health
veda skills uninstall   # remove them
```

`veda init` runs `skills install` as part of first-time setup. The skills travel inside
the compiled `veda` binary as embedded assets, so install needs nothing on disk except
the binary. See [`.agents/skills/README.md`](.agents/skills/README.md) for the full
discovery layout.

## How-To Guides

### Manage File Selection

```bash
export VEDA_SESSION=my-session

veda sel add "src/*.ts"           # Add files (quote globs)
veda sel add main.ts:10-50        # Add line range (1-indexed)
veda sel ls                       # List with token counts
veda sel rm main.ts               # Remove file and all its slices
veda sel clear                    # Clear all
```

### Use Different Backends

```bash
veda -b codex "..."        # OpenAI Codex (default)
veda -b claude-code "..."  # Anthropic Claude Code
veda -b droid "..."        # Factory Droid (droid exec)
veda -b pi "..."          # pi CLI (any provider/model from ~/.pi/agent/models.json)
veda -b agy "..."         # Google Antigravity CLI (agy headless mode)
```

**Note on reasoning configuration:**
- **Codex:** Uses native `model_reasoning_effort` flag. The `--reasoning` flag works as expected.
- **Claude Code:** Maps `--reasoning` levels to the `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` environment variable automatically.
- **pi CLI:** Maps `--reasoning` to pi's `--thinking` flag and `--sandbox` to pi's `--tools` flag. Supports any provider/model defined in `~/.pi/agent/models.json`.
- **Droid:** Maps `--reasoning` to `-r` flag and `--sandbox` to `--auto` flag. Supports any model available to `droid exec`. Droid has no true zero-tool switch (`--enabled-tools ''` is parsed as "no restriction" and `--disabled-tools '*'` is rejected), so the no-tools policy passes `--disabled-tools` with the full tool-id list (verified to block tool calls in a live probe) plus the no-tools notice in the system prompt. The list is pinned in `DROID_ALL_TOOL_IDS`; a droid release that adds tools makes runs fail loudly with "Unknown tool identifier(s)" — refresh the list from `droid exec --list-tools` then.
- **agy:** Maps `--reasoning` to `--effort low|medium|high` (six veda levels clamp: minimal/low→low, high/xhigh/max→high). Capability-suffixed slugs like `gemini-3.1-pro-high` encode their own effort, so `--effort` is omitted for those. Tool policy is advisory: agy has no per-run tool allowlist, so persona tool limits ride in the system prompt and agy's permission rules arbitrate. `--sandbox full` maps to `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; read-only and workspace-write use agy's defaults (workspace file writes are auto-allowed; shell commands soft-deny). `veda resume` continues agy conversations by explicit conversation id. Models: `agy models` lists valid slugs (`gemini-3.1-pro-high`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, ...); an unknown slug fails loudly.

### Use Model Aliases

Model aliases auto-select the correct backend:

```bash
# Claude models (→ claude-code backend)
veda -m opus "..."      # Uses claude-code with opus
veda -m sonnet "..."    # Uses claude-code with sonnet
veda -m haiku "..."     # Uses claude-code with haiku

# OpenAI models (→ codex backend)
veda -m gpt "..."       # Uses codex with gpt-5.2


# pi models (→ pi backend, auto-inferred from pi/ prefix)
veda -m pi/wafer/glm-5.1 "..."                        # wafer provider
veda -m pi/fireworks/accounts/fireworks/routers/kimi-k2p6 "..."  # fireworks provider
veda -m pi/neuralwatt/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6 "..."      # neuralwatt provider

# Antigravity models (→ agy backend)
veda -m gemini "..."              # Uses agy with gemini-3.1-pro-high
veda -m agy-flash "..."           # Uses agy with gemini-3.6-flash-medium
veda -m agy/gemini-3.6-flash-low "..."  # agy/ prefix auto-infers the agy backend
veda -b agy -m claude-sonnet-4-6 "..."  # agy-hosted Claude (needs explicit -b; bare claude-* goes to claude-code)
```

When you specify both `-b` and `-m`, the model is passed literally (no alias resolution).

**User-defined aliases.** Add your own aliases to `~/.config/veda/config`; they override
the built-in table and work everywhere `-m` works (base persona, worker, and deep-mode
solver/judge/verifier/revision slots):

```bash
# ~/.config/veda/config — comma-separated name=full-model[:reasoning]
MODEL_ALIASES="flash=pi/neuralwatt/deepseek-v4-flash"
```

```bash
veda -m flash "..."        # → pi backend, pi/neuralwatt/deepseek-v4-flash
```

**Note:** The `--reasoning` flag (`-r`) is fully supported by the Codex backend, automatically configured for the Claude backend (mapped to `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`), and supported by the Gemini backend (via scoped settings.json override with automatic cleanup).

### Resume Conversations

```bash
veda -S agent-1 "Design a distributed lock"
veda -S agent-1 resume "What about fairness?"
veda -S agent-1 resume -- "--explain flags"  # Prompt with dashes
```

### Use Deep Thinking Mode

```bash
veda deep "Complex design question"           # 3 solvers, verification on
veda deep -k 5 "Critical architecture"        # 5 solvers
veda deep --no-verify "Quick comparison"      # Skip verification
veda deep --trace /tmp/trace.yaml "..."       # Save trace for debugging
veda deep --json "..." | jq '.candidates'     # JSON output

# Per-stage model/backend overrides (mixed providers)
veda deep --solver-model opus --judge-model gpt "..."
veda deep --solver-backend claude-code --verifier-backend codex "..."
```

**Backend/Model Precedence:**

The `-b` and `-m` flags apply to **all stages** (solver, judge, verifier, revision) unless overridden by per-stage flags:

```bash
# All stages use codex:gpt-5.2
veda deep -b codex -m gpt-5.2 "..."

# All stages use codex:gpt-5.2, except judge uses claude-code:opus
veda deep -m gpt-5.2 --judge-model opus "..."

# -m infers backend from model: opus → claude-code for all stages
veda deep -m opus "..."
```

Precedence order (highest to lowest):
1. Per-stage CLI flags (`--judge-model`, `--verifier-backend`, etc.)
2. Base CLI flags (`-b`, `-m`): applies to all stages
3. Config file stage defaults (`DEEP_JUDGE_MODEL`, etc.): only when no `-b`/`-m`
4. Global defaults

**Reasoning Precedence:**

The `-r` flag also applies to **all stages** (solver, judge, verifier, revision) unless overridden by per-stage flags:

```bash
# All stages use high reasoning
veda deep -r high "Complex analysis"

# All stages use high, except verifier uses xhigh
veda deep -r high --verifier-reasoning xhigh "..."

# Per-stage reasoning flags (no -r)
veda deep --solver-reasoning medium --judge-reasoning high "..."
```

Precedence order (highest to lowest):
1. Per-stage CLI flags (`--solver-reasoning`, `--judge-reasoning`, etc.)
2. Base CLI flag (`-r`): applies to all stages
3. Config file stage defaults (`DEEP_SOLVER_REASONING`, etc.): only when no `-r`
4. Stage defaults (solver: medium, judge: medium, verifier: high, revision: high)

**Distribute solvers across multiple backends:**
```bash
# Even distribution: 2 solvers per backend (k=6, 3 backends)
veda deep -k 6 --distribute-solvers "Complex problem"
veda deep -k 6 --distribute-solvers --solver-backends claude-code,codex,droid "Custom backends"
```

Order is deterministic: explicit `--solver-backends` is normalized (trim/lowercase/dedup) and sorted before round-robin.

**Note:** `-m` cannot be used with `--distribute-solvers` across multiple backends (use `--solver-model` instead).

**Listed mode: compare specific models on the same prompt:**
```bash
# One solver per model; every solver gets the identical prompt (no module rotation)
veda deep --solver-models sol,k3,fable "Design a rate limiter"

# Zip a reasoning module onto each slot, positionally
veda deep --solver-models sol,k3 --modules analytical/causal_analysis,systematic/systems_thinking "..."
```
Each entry resolves through the alias/prefix machinery, so backend, model, and per-alias reasoning are pinned per slot (`--solver-reasoning` overrides all slot hints). Roster size is the list length (`-k` may only confirm it). Repeat entries to duplicate a model (`sol,sol,k3`). Conflicts with `-m`, `--solver-model`, `--solver-backend(s)`, `--distribute-solvers`, `--categories`, `--uniform`, and `--low-count-modules`. Config equivalent: `DEEP_SOLVER_MODELS=sol,k3,fable`.

### Use Personas

```bash
veda -p navigator-plan "..."        # Plan + program-design protocol (high)
veda -p navigator-chat "..."        # Discussion (medium reasoning)
veda -p reviewer "..."             # Code review — P0/P1/P2 findings (medium reasoning, no tools)
veda -p worker "..."                # Execute an implementation task (writes your repo)
veda personas                      # List available
```

#### The Worker persona (write-capable)

The **worker** is veda's first write-capable seat. It inverts the advisory
personas' defaults — `tools: all` and `sandbox: workspace-write` — and is meant
for bounded implementation tasks a Driver can fully specify.

```bash
# Delegate an implementation task; tools on, workspace-write sandbox
veda -S feat-42 -p worker "Implement slice 1 of design.json; run the slice tests"

# -m semantics are identical to every other persona
veda -S feat-42 -p worker -m opus "Apply the auth fix from design.json"
```

Every worker run ends with a mandatory `<worker_report>` block (Factory's
subagent handoff contract) parsed by veda into `report.yaml` in the session
dir — `<project>/.veda/sessions/<session>/report.yaml` (project-local; `~/.config/veda/sessions/` outside a git repo) — alongside the full
raw transcript `response.yaml`. A Driver (often another agent) branches on
`report.yaml`:

```bash
STATUS=$(yq '.status' "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.veda/sessions/feat-42/report.yaml")
case "$STATUS" in
  completed) veda -S feat-42 -p reviewer "Review the diff against design.json" ;;
  blocked)   veda -S feat-42 resume "$(yq '.needs' .../report.yaml)" ;;
  failed)    # route discovered_issues back to navigator-plan ;;
esac
```

Because the worker edits your repo by default, its run header shows the
sandbox mode up front, and `--sandbox read-only` is always available to run it
as a dry-run planner (a report with no edits). The worker stays in scope:
tools on, workspace-write — both overridable via `--tools`/`--no-tools` and
`--sandbox`.

This orchestration workflow is bundled as the **`veda-worker`** agent skill
(from the caller's point of view: *you* orchestrate plan → one worker run → verify;
the *worker* drives the implementation). Install it with `veda skills install`.

#### The Reviewer persona

The **reviewer** reviews a patch — the git diff plus the selected file
context — and reports only discrete, actionable findings grouped by severity
(`P0` must fix, `P1` should fix, `P2` consider). It runs with **no tools**: it
reviews the diff/context and `design.json` (auto-attached) it is given, and
names any missing artifact rather than searching for it.

```bash
git diff > /tmp/changes.diff
veda -S feat-42 sel add /tmp/changes.diff
veda -S feat-42 -p reviewer "Review the diff against the design; report P0/P1/P2 findings"
```

The reviewer ends with a verdict line the orchestrator branches on:
`review: pass` (no P0/P1 findings) or `review: needs-fix` (P0/P1 present —
route them back to the worker). This drives a **review → fix → re-review**
loop: fix P0/P1 findings, regenerate the diff, and re-review until `pass`
(P2 may stay open).

### Core Primitives

The library uses data-oriented primitives (plain data structs with standalone functions):

**LLM Call**: Single model invocation
```typescript
interface LlmRequest {
  backend: string;
  prompt: string;
  context?: string;
  systemPrompt: string;
  model?: string;
  reasoning?: 'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'xhigh' | 'max';
  sandbox?: 'read-only' | 'workspace-write' | 'full';
}

// Usage
const response = await runLlm(request);
console.log(response.text, response.usage);
```

**Ensemble**: Parallel LLM calls
```typescript
const result = await runEnsemble([
  { id: 'solver-1', request: { backend: 'codex', prompt, systemPrompt: '...' } },
  { id: 'solver-2', request: { backend: 'codex', prompt, systemPrompt: '...' } },
]);
console.log(result.successful); // Array of response texts
```

**Judge**: Select best candidate
```typescript
const result = await runJudge({
  backend: 'codex',
  systemPrompt: JUDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
  candidates: ['Answer A', 'Answer B', 'Answer C'],
  originalTask: 'What is 2+2?',
});
console.log(result.selected, result.decision.confidence);
```

**Verification**: Chain-of-Verification for fact-checking
```typescript
const result = await runVerification({
  backend: 'codex',
  systemPrompt: VERIFIER_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
  type: 'reasoning',
  draft: 'The answer is 42',
  originalTask: 'What is the meaning of life?',
});
console.log(result.checks, result.results, result.revision);
```

### Deep Thinking Pipeline

                 │     Answer      │
                 └─────────────────┘
```

**Verification triggers when:**
- Judge confidence is below 70% (medium or low)

### Reasoning Modules

Each solver uses a different cognitive strategy from 8 categories. Modules are sourced from Polya's "How to Solve It", Hamming's "Art of Doing Science and Engineering", and McKinsey problem-solving frameworks.

| Category | Focus | Example Modules |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| `analytical` | Critical thinking, root cause analysis | so_what_test, eighty_twenty_focus, causal_analysis |
| `creative` | Novel solutions, reframing | invert_the_problem, first_principles, radical_rethinking |
| `systematic` | Structured decomposition | mece_decomposition, issue_tree, working_backward |
| `strategic` | Planning, hypothesis-driven | hypothesis_first, analogical_transfer, planning |
| `evaluative` | Risk assessment, tradeoffs | risk_assessment, check_completeness, tradeoff_analysis |
| `contextual` | Stakeholder analysis, constraints | stakeholder_analysis, resource_constraints |
| `empirical` | Evidence-based validation | experimental_design, historical_analysis, data_driven |
| `reflective` | Meta-cognition, success criteria | reflective_thinking, success_criteria, decision_under_uncertainty |

```bash
# By category (random module from each)
veda deep --categories analytical,evaluative "Should we use microservices?"

# Exact modules with category/id format
veda deep --modules analytical/so_what_test,systematic/mece_decomposition "Analyze design"

# Mix exact and random: exact analytical, random creative, exact systematic
veda deep --modules analytical/so_what_test,creative,systematic/working_backward "Complex question"
```

### Backends

Each backend normalizes to a common `Message` stream:

```typescript
interface Message {
  type: 'init' | 'text' | 'reasoning' | 'tool_use' | 'tool_result' | 'error' | 'done';
  content?: string;
  sessionId?: string;
  usage?: { inputTokens: number; outputTokens: number };
}
```

### Sessions

Sessions isolate state between concurrent agents:
- File selection: `<project>/.veda/sessions/<id>/selection` (global fallback `~/.config/veda/sessions/`)
- Thread info: `<project>/.veda/sessions/<id>/thread.json` (global fallback `~/.config/veda/sessions/`)
